# Get-Started-with-Qiskit-Seminar
Learn about Quantum Computation and get started with Qiskit and Python! 

In my Quantum computation and Quantum Information course, we used Qiskit and Python to create our own quantum circuits and some project 
that implemented them. 

I gave a lecture to my classmates on how to get started with no knowledge of Python or Qiskit. We quickly built up to creating our first
quantum algorithm which was implementing quantum teleportation! 

Follow along with the Seminar.pdf and try out qiskit in your favorite text editor or in jupyter notebooks(setup shown in Seminar.pdf). 
I also include my raw Seminar.ipynb file to use in ntoebooks from my seminar session as well as Teaching!.py which is my own notes I used
to help create this little seminar.
